Lyrics:
I''m tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don''t know what you''re expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)

I''ve become so numb, I can''t feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I''m becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

Can''t you see that you''re smothering me
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?
''Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take

I''ve become so numb, I can''t feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I''m becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you

I''ve become so numb, I can''t feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I''m becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you

I''ve become so numb, I can''t feel you there
(I''m tired of being what you want me to be)
I''ve become so numb, I can''t feel you there
(I''m tired of being what you want me to be)

Lyrics:

Every breath you take and every move you make
Every bond you break, every step you take, I''ll be watching you
Every single day, every word you say
Every game you play, every night you stay, I''ll be watching you

Oh can''t you see, you belong to me
How my poor heart aches with every step you take

Every move you make and every vow you break
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake, I''ll be watching you

Since you''ve gone I''ve been lost without a trace
I dream at night I can only see your face
I look around, but it''s you I can''t replace
I feel so cold and I long for your embrace
I keep crying baby, baby, please

Oh can''t you see, you belong to me
How my poor heart aches with every step you take

Every move you make and every vow you break
Every smile you fake, every claim you stake, I''ll be watching you
Every move you make, every step you take, I''ll be watching you

I''ll be watching you
(Every breath you take, every move you make)
(Every bond you break, every step you take)
I''ll be watching you
(Every single day, every word you say)
(Every game you play, every night you stay)
I''ll be watching you
(Every move you make, every vow you break)
(Every smile you fake, every claim you stake)
I''ll be watching you
(Every single day, every word you say)
(Every game you play, every night you stay)
I''ll be watching you
(Every breath you take, every move you make)
(Every bond you break, every step you take)
I''ll be watching you
(Every single day, every word you say)
(Every game you play, every night you stay)
I''ll be watching you
(Every move you make, every vow you break)
(Every smile you fake, every claim you stake)
I''ll be watching you
I''ll be watching you
(Every single day, every word you say)
(Every game you play, every night you stay)
I''ll be watching you

Lyrics: 
So close no matter how far
Couldn''t be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don''t just say
And nothing else matters
Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

So close no matter how far
It couldn''t be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

I never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don''t just say
And nothing else matters
Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah-yeah!

So close no matter how far
Couldn''t be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
No, nothing else matters

Evanescence are celebrating the 20th anniversary of Fallen with a series of special reissues via Craft Recordings. 

Details/order: https://found.ee/fallen20 

Available on Deluxe 2-LP, 2-CD, and Digital — as well as a Super Deluxe Edition collector’s box set — Fallen (20th Anniversary Edition) offers newly remastered audio, including the album’s singles “My Immortal,” “Going Under,” “Everybody’s Fool,” and “Bring Me To Life.” The expanded set also includes a trove of bonus material – ten tracks in all – comprising previously-unreleased demos and live recordings plus a selection of rare B-sides. Alongside reimagined artwork, all physical formats will include previously-unseen photos from the era, plus a handwritten foreword by Amy Lee, who oversaw all aspects of the reissue. The Deluxe vinyl, CD and digital configurations are out now. 

Available exclusively at Evanescence.com is the Super Deluxe Box Set, arriving February, 2024. Housed in a collectible shadow box-style package (inspired by Amy’s songwriting journal cover art), this limited edition includes all of the above-mentioned music as part of a 2-LP set (featuring a Black & Silver blend vinyl) plus a bonus cassette of previously unreleased demos and voice notes which is exclusive to this box set. Adding additional insight into the album is an expansive book which features new track-by-track notes from Lee, while a zoetropic turntable slipmat, rare photo prints, and enamel pin set round out the collection.

Lyrics:

Looking back at me I see
That I never really got it right
I never stopped to think of you
I''m always wrapped up in
Things I cannot win
You are the antidote that gets me by
Something strong
Like a drug that gets me high

What I really meant to say
Is I''m sorry for the way I am
I never meant to be so cold 

To you I''m sorry about all the lies
Maybe in a different light
You could see me stand on my own again
Cause now i can see
You were the antidote that got me by
Something strong like a drug that got me high"','2024-10-10T16:04:27.953802+00:00');
